# Simon-Game
Hello everyone ! I made a Simon playing game. The Simon game is the exciting electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. 

This is a fun and challenging memory game where you follow a sequence of colored button presses. Test your memory and see how high you can score!
