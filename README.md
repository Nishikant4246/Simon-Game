# Simon-Game
Hello everyone ! I made a Simon playing game. The Simon game is the exciting electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. 

This is a fun and challenging memory game where you follow a sequence of colored button presses. Test your memory and see how high you can score!

## How to Play a game 
 ### Start the Game: 
    Step 1: Let's Start the Game.
     Press any key to start the game.
    
    Step 2: Watch the Sequence: 
     The game will display a sequence of colored buttons lighting up one by one. Focus on the order as they illuminate.
     
    Step 3: Repeat the Sequence: 
     Once the sequence is complete, it's your turn! Click on the colored buttons in the exact same order as shown by the game.
     
    Step 4: Progress and Difficulty: 
     If you successfully repeat the sequence, you advance to the next level! The sequence will typically get longer and more complex as you progress.
     
    Condition: Game Over: If you click the wrong button at any point, the game ends and your score (the highest level reached) is displayed.
